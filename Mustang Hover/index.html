        <h2>Ford Mustang 1969</h2>
        <p>The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March
          1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of
          automobiles known as pony cars. The Mustang's styling, with its long
          hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of
          competition. It was introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and
          convertible with the fastback version to follow in August 1964. Upon
          introduction, the Mustang, sharing its platform with the Falcon, was
          slotted into the compact car segment.</p>
